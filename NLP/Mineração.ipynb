The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. If you want\\r\\nmy objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our\\r\\ntrade imbalance.

On the contrary, a slight rise\\r\\nin exports can be expected.\\r\\n    The institute said past experience has shown West German\\r\\nexporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by\\r\\ncutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting\\r\\ntheir product ranges.\\r\\n    They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in\\r\\neconomic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the\\r\\ndecline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow\\r\\nthis year.\\r\\n    West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed\\r\\nadvances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both\\r\\nof which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary\\r\\npolicy, the institute said.\\r\\n    However, it said the labour market would see only a slight\\r\\nimprovement because companies will be reluctant to hire\\r\\nadditional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by\\r\\nagreed reductions in working hours.\\r\\n    The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of\\r\\nmonetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked\\r\\nacceleration of inflation.\\r\\n    It also warned that what it called the worldwide\\r\\nsynchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new\\r\\nglobal recession. It said central banks in industrialized\\r\\ncountries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal\\r\\nReserve Boards expansionary course.\\r\\n    The institute said this in turn was bound to lead\\r\\neventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S.\\r\\nPolicy towards a more restrictive policy.

Some of them are too sophisticated to\\r\\nconvert into financial terms, one banking source said.\\r\\n    But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is\\r\\nimpossible to calculate.\\r\\n    They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Polands\\r\\neconomy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.\\r\\n    Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under-\\r\\nachieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only\\r\\ncontributed to largely internal, economic problems, one said.\\r\\n    The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured\\r\\nNation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation\\r\\nfor suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under\\r\\nmartial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was\\r\\noriginally devised several years ago by the Institute of\\r\\nNational Economy, an offshoot of the central planning\\r\\ncommission.\\r\\n    According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish\\r\\neconomic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth\\r\\ntrends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in\\r\\ncredits from Western commercial and government lenders.\\r\\n    But the calculations were based on a time when trade was\\r\\nbooming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing\\r\\nthe estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point,\\r\\nwhich has no real scientific evaluation.\\r\\n    A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to\\r\\nthe U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs\\r\\nannually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were\\r\\nimposed.\\r\\n    Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to\\r\\n200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade\\r\\nsurplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs\\r\\nagainst a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.\\r\\n    Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important\\r\\nU.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles,\\r\\nchemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits\\r\\ndried up for economic not political reasons.  Poland is\\r\\naccusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for\\r\\npolitical reasons, said one expert. Its an illusion based on a\\r\\nmisunderstanding of Western economy.\\r\\n    Theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone\\r\\nwho has no hope of repaying it, another said, adding that\\r\\nPoland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits\\r\\nin the 1970s which were no longer todays reality.\\r\\n    Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as nebulous, one\\r\\ndiplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders\\r\\nand setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of\\r\\nscientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the\\r\\nlifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact\\r\\non Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs\\r\\nand lacks the means to modernise its industry.\\r\\n    MFN doesnt really mean anything, only that Poland will not\\r\\nbe treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to\\r\\nregain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are\\r\\nin play now, said one Western envoy.\\r\\n    He said Polish products were not competitive, and their\\r\\nquality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist\\r\\nmeasures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper\\r\\nPolands efforts to regain entry.\\r\\n    Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised\\r\\nthis fact recently.\\r\\n    Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, Making\\r\\nup our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly\\r\\ndifficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of\\r\\ntwo to three years it will be possible to increase the level of\\r\\nexports by only about 100 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it\\r\\nhas a moral right to assistance from the U.S. Which it says\\r\\nimposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said\\r\\nThe argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing\\r\\nof the Polish economy wont cut any ice. The Americans will\\r\\njust reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing\\r\\nSolidarity.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in\\r\\ntalks in Washington last week with the International Monetary\\r\\nFund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was\\r\\nlooking for a lead from the United States.\\r\\n    He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its\\r\\nfinancial obligations to the United States, but not in a short\\r\\ntime and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its\\r\\nforeign economic partners.\\r\\n    He stressed that the U.S. had a particular opportunity to\\r\\nplay a part in the cooperative policy of Polands partners\\r\\ninterested in the settlement of Polish debt.\\r\\n    Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed\\r\\nWashington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and\\r\\nParis Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and\\r\\nsaid it should now play a more positive role.\\r\\n    As a major superpower the United States can influence\\r\\ninternational organisations, he said, citing recent meetings\\r\\naimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to\\r\\nwhich Western nations were prepared to cooperate.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG Britain had a visible trade deficit of\\r\\n2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised\\r\\ndeficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official\\r\\nstatistics show.\\r\\n    Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central\\r\\nStatistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in\\r\\ndeficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third\\r\\nquarter shortfall of 930 mln.\\r\\n    For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3\\r\\nbillion stg, sharply up from 1985s 2.2.

Shell Transport and Trading\\r\\nPlc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg\\r\\nfrom a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a\\r\\ngeneral collapse in exploration and production volumes was\\r\\npartially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln\\r\\nstg from 205 mln in 1985.\\r\\n    Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected\\r\\ncurrency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter\\r\\nresults, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding\\r\\nforecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete\\r\\nWedd noted.\\r\\n    However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in\\r\\nperformance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the\\r\\nimprobability that the group would be able to repeat the high\\r\\nrefining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.\\r\\n    The impact of recovering oil prices would come through\\r\\nfaster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a\\r\\nhigh proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which\\r\\ntypically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year\\r\\nlag, analysts said.\\r\\n    Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third\\r\\nquarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.\\r\\n    Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in\\r\\nthe period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in\\r\\nU.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group\\r\\nhad increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes\\r\\nadded.\\r\\n    Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue\\r\\nU.S. Exploration activity. Exploration is currently pretty\\r\\nflat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no\\r\\nmassive upturn, he said.\\r\\n    A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North\\r\\nSea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n    Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. If\\r\\nyou are not exploring you are not going to find anything, he\\r\\nnoted.\\r\\n    U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day\\r\\n(bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed\\r\\nbelow 20 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n    This favored OPECs attempts to stabilise prices, as the\\r\\nlower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC\\r\\nmarginal production shutting down. OPEC has done pretty\\r\\nextraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spains\\r\\ndecision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings\\r\\nbanks, saying it reflected the socialist governments\\r\\ndetermination not to ease up in the fight against inflation\\r\\ndespite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.\\r\\n    The central bank last night raised the requirement by one\\r\\npercentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess\\r\\nliquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.\\r\\n    Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the\\r\\nBank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to\\r\\nchoke off money supply growth.\\r\\n    I think its a good measure, a senior foreign banker said.\\r\\nIts a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates\\r\\nand avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy.\\r\\n    It shows that the political will is very strong. They know\\r\\nthat controlling inflation will make industry more competitive\\r\\nand bring down unemployment in the long run, he added.\\r\\n    The head of another foreign bank said that only a month\\r\\nago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise\\r\\nin reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of\\r\\nraising interest rates.\\r\\n    But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now\\r\\n-- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money\\r\\nfrom abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish\\r\\nexports less competitive.\\r\\n    The government says industrys competitiveness is also\\r\\nbeing hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was\\r\\nway above that of Spains major trading partners in the\\r\\nEuropean Community, which it joined a year ago.\\r\\n    To help meet this years target of five pct, it is\\r\\ninsisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for\\r\\nclashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough\\r\\nsacrifices.\\r\\n    Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose\\r\\ndemands essentially involve more government spending, have\\r\\nbecome an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe\\r\\nGonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.\\r\\n    Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have\\r\\nsome impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the\\r\\nmoney market too hard.\\r\\n    The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key\\r\\novernight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at\\r\\ntodays auction. The rate has been increased nine times since\\r\\nthe start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.\\r\\n    Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in\\r\\nany case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate\\r\\nbanks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.\\r\\n    The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the\\r\\npublication of the decree in todays official gazette. Bankers\\r\\nsay the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and,\\r\\ninevitably, push lending rates higher.\\r\\n    A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which\\r\\nbanks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect\\r\\ntomorrow.

The\\r\\nstatement said only that the reduction in total supplies,\\r\\nnamely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local\\r\\ndeliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as\\r\\nthose supplies fell very noticeably during that month.\\r\\n    No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters\\r\\nto align the official selling price to the ongoing market\\r\\nprice, member countries are, without exception, strictly\\r\\nadhering to the official selling price in spite of the\\r\\nfinancial hardship this may entail, the statement said.\\r\\n    The very recent improvement in the price structure is an\\r\\nindicator of such determination by the organization to stick to\\r\\nthe official selling price, the statement said.\\r\\n    Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel in early December last year to near OPECs official\\r\\nlevels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.\\r\\n    There has been oil

But critics have\\r\\nbeen warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs\\r\\nis helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.\\r\\n    Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases\\r\\nthat develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect\\r\\nhumans.\\r\\n    But the new study, reported in Thursdays New England\\r\\nJournal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.\\r\\n    The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number\\r\\nof people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant\\r\\ninfection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to\\r\\n298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the\\r\\nvictims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized\\r\\nfor their illness.\\r\\n    They also discovered that cooking the meat didnt always\\r\\nprevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating\\r\\nraw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, the\\r\\nmajority of cases appear to have been caused by eating\\r\\nhamburger that was at least partially cooked.\\r\\n    The researchers said the results show that food animals are\\r\\na major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections\\r\\nin humans, and that these infections are associated with\\r\\n(antibiotic) use on farms.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'EC REJECTS ALL FREE MARKET WHEAT EXPORT  OFFERS AT WEEKLY TENDER -

But by\\r\\nthen sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of\\r\\nEngland, he added.\\r\\n    The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting\\r\\npressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources\\r\\nsaid the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more\\r\\nthan just marking up by foreign exchange traders.\\r\\n    Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially\\r\\nharmful news on the trade front, todays figures showing that\\r\\nthe current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.\\r\\n    This was above previous estimates of the current account\\r\\ndeficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.\\r\\n    Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would\\r\\nhave given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they\\r\\nwere too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.\\r\\n    The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing\\r\\nbanks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank\\r\\nofficials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this\\r\\nweek, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow.\\r\\nIf a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point\\r\\ncut, with another half or full point about Budget day.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ENGELHARD CORP &lt;EC> SETS STOCK SPLIT Engelhard Corp said its board\\r\\ndeclared a three-for-two stock split and raised the quarterly\\r\\ndividend to 19-1/2 cts per share presplit from 19 cts, both\\r\\npayable March 31 to holders of record March 17.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'EGYPTIAN 1986 CRUDE OIL OUTPUT DOWN ON 1985 Non-Opec Egypt produced 40.3 mln tonnes\\r\\n(about 295 mln barrels) of crude in 1986 against 44.3 mln\\r\\ntonnes (about 323 mln barrels) in 1985, according to official\\r\\nfigures released today by the Egyptian General Petroleum Corp.\\r\\n(EGPC).\\r\\n    Officials say Egypt can produce up to one mln bpd per day,\\r\\nbut production was cut when world prices plunged last year.\\r\\n    In an attempt to help OPEC stabilize the world market,\\r\\nEgypt cut its 1987 production target of 940,000 bpd to its\\r\\ncurrent output of 870,000 bpd.\\r\\n    Egypt, which exports a third of its output, currently sells\\r\\nits top Suez and Ras Bahar blends for 17.25 dlrs a barrel.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS Switzerlands economy, combining low\\r\\nunemployment, financial stability and a large external payments\\r\\nsurplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory\\r\\nfuture, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\\r\\nDevelopment, OECD, said.\\r\\n    This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight\\r\\nfiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out\\r\\nsome signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in\\r\\ninflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.\\r\\n    The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product\\r\\ngrowth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986\\r\\nand a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after\\r\\nlast years sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.\\r\\n    But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest\\r\\nincrease in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate\\r\\nunchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial\\r\\nnation OECD area.\\r\\n    Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to\\r\\nthe dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986,\\r\\nthe report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct\\r\\nrise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct\\r\\nrespectively in 1986.\\r\\n    The faster growth of imports compared with exports this\\r\\nyear and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant\\r\\nthat the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP\\r\\nwould shrink in both years.\\r\\n    But given Switzerlands large external surplus, there\\r\\nshould be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than\\r\\nGDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to\\r\\nimproving international balances, the OECD said.\\r\\n    Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually\\r\\nbuoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several\\r\\nyears of relative weakness, it noted.\\r\\n    In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat\\r\\nto a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall\\r\\nGDP, it added.\\r\\n    The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained\\r\\nbright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels\\r\\nlast year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation\\r\\nin both the industry and service sectors, it said.\\r\\n    As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment\\r\\ninvestment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year\\r\\nafter vigorous growth in 1986.\\r\\n    But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for\\r\\ntourism and the banking industry, two major service sector\\r\\nearners of foreign exchange.\\r\\n    The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the\\r\\naccelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could\\r\\nlead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.\\r\\n    Particularly for the banks, recent developments in\\r\\ninternational financial markets give rise to the question\\r\\nwhether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial\\r\\nflexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed\\r\\nrequired ...

The agreement\\r\\nsimply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in\\r\\nTokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.\\r\\n    You have to look at the dollars peak compared with now,\\r\\nand that was well before Plaza, he said.\\r\\n    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at\\r\\n263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was\\r\\n242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and\\r\\nperiodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the\\r\\ndollar trend has been down, down, down.\\r\\n    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross\\r\\nrates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The\\r\\nEuropean currencies are moving back up against the yen.\\r\\n    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade\\r\\nflows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but\\r\\nundoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is\\r\\nchanging. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC\\r\\nboth grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.\\r\\nThis gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.\\r\\n    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of\\r\\nof sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.\\r\\n    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12\\r\\npct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports\\r\\nand 21 pct for imports in yen terms.\\r\\n    The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a\\r\\ntremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit\\r\\nsold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important\\r\\nto them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is\\r\\nlaying the golden egg, said de Hora.\\r\\n    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year\\r\\nin Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its\\r\\nstart from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.\\r\\n    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than\\r\\nU.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate\\r\\nimbalance, and which will cause problems.\\r\\n    This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is\\r\\nreflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But\\r\\ntherefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive\\r\\nedge, said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International\\r\\nEconomic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. If you want\\r\\nmy objective view, I dont expect a drastic improvement in our\\r\\ntrade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,\\r\\nand this year we may have to do so again, he said.\\r\\n REUTER...\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'TANDEM COMPUTERS &lt;TNDM> SEES HIGHER NET Tandem Computers Inc said it expects\\r\\nhigher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter\\r\\nending March 31 against a year ago.\\r\\n    We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the\\r\\nquarter, James Treybig, president and and chief executive\\r\\nofficer, told a meeting of securities analysts.\\r\\n    In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned\\r\\n9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln\\r\\ndlrs.\\r\\n    Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the\\r\\nquarter but he said the results might be lower than those for\\r\\nthe first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln\\r\\ndlrs or 58 cts a share.

The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and\\r\\nstill receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.\\r\\n    The administration has strongly urged that the bill be\\r\\nexpanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.\\r\\n    It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision\\r\\nwill emerge from the committee, the sources said.\\r\\n    Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large\\r\\nestimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates\\r\\nby the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this\\r\\ntime is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of\\r\\nthe bill, committee staffers said.\\r\\n    The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A\\r\\nconflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and\\r\\nstaffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.\\r\\n    Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an\\r\\nexpanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of\\r\\nthe country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup\\r\\nfor the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.\\r\\n    Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so\\r\\nsomething has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be\\r\\nimplemented, an Agriculture Department source said.\\r\\n    An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last\\r\\nweeks subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee\\r\\nchairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the\\r\\nconsequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was\\r\\nnecessary.\\r\\n    Major commodity groups, including the National Corn\\r\\nGrowers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemens\\r\\nAssociation, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.\\r\\n    But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill\\r\\ncurrently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it\\r\\nshould be extended to other crops.\\r\\n    There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said\\r\\nGene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.\\r\\n    Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to\\r\\ndecrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the\\r\\ndebate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.\\r\\n    Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce\\r\\na bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the\\r\\nargument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major\\r\\nchanges in the farm bill.\\r\\n    Stenholms bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the\\r\\ntiming, a congressional staff member said.\\r\\n    Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an\\r\\namendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988\\r\\nfeedgrains.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'YELLOW FREIGHT &lt;YELL> SEES LOWER 1ST QTR NET Yellow Freight System Inc said\\r\\nits expects 1987 first quarter profits to be substantially\\r\\nbelow the 14.2 mln dlrs or 50 cts a share earned in the same\\r\\nperiod a year ago.\\r\\n    Revenues have been depressed by recent price discounting,\\r\\nadded costs from expansion programs, lower shipping volumes and\\r\\nincreased costs associated with severe weather conditions\\r\\non the East coast, company officials told analysts here.\\r\\n    An industry-wide rate hike of 2.9 pct, set for April one,\\r\\nwill cover Yellow Freights upcoming labor and other costs but\\r\\nwill not make a contribution to operating margins, it said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'NOVA SUBSIDIARY RAISES U.S. POLYETHYLENE PRICES Novacor Inc, a unit of &lt;Nova,\\r\\nan Alberta Corp>, said it would raise prices for U.S. customers\\r\\nby five cts a pound on linear low-density and low-density\\r\\npolyethylene, effective April 1.\\r\\n    The company did not immediately disclose the actual new\\r\\nprices.\\r\\n    A Novacor official later said in reply to an inquiry that\\r\\nthe new prices, effective April 1, would range from 31 U.S. cts\\r\\na pound to about 38 cts.\\r\\n    The official said the increase reflected improved market\\r\\nconditions, although he noted the new prices would still be\\r\\nlower than those of three years ago.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MOULINEX STAKE SOLD TO SOME 50 INSTITUTIONS The 20 pct stake in Moulinex SA &lt;MOUP.PA>\\r\\nsold by &lt;Scovill Inc> of the U.S. Was spread among at least 50\\r\\ninstitutional investors worldwide, a spokesman for brokers\\r\\nJames Capel said.

The move complicated a USAir\\r\\ntakeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to\\r\\naccepting the bid.\\r\\n    Today, USAir rejected Icahns 52 dlr per share offer and\\r\\nsaid the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its\\r\\ntakeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.\\r\\n    Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was\\r\\noff 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread\\r\\nit would be taken over.\\r\\n    Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt\\r\\nto either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a\\r\\nsuitor who might want both airlines once they merged.\\r\\n   The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir announce a deal, speculated one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current\\r\\nprice of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAirs bid will\\r\\nsucceed.\\r\\n    Piedmonts largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk\\r\\nSouthern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the\\r\\ncompany. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of\\r\\nPiedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.\\r\\n    Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of\\r\\nPiedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is\\r\\ndestined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the\\r\\nleast likely to be bought.\\r\\n    Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in\\r\\nthe airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a\\r\\nthree-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.\\r\\n    But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahns\\r\\noffer, which lacked financing and was riddled with\\r\\ncontingencies.\\r\\n    Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two\\r\\nairlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.\\r\\n    You cant discount him, said one arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is\\r\\nserious by following through with his threats or making a new\\r\\noffer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go\\r\\ndirectly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower\\r\\nprice if USAir rejected his offer.\\r\\n    Its clear Icahn wants to sell and hes bluffing, said\\r\\none arbitrager.\\r\\n    Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by\\r\\nabout six dlrs per share.\\r\\n    Some analysts believe Icahns proposed three-way airline\\r\\ncombination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but\\r\\nothers believe it could be cleared if the companies are\\r\\nacquired separately.\\r\\n    TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to\\r\\nwork, said one analyst.\\r\\n    Analysts said such a merger would be costly and\\r\\ncomplicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn\\r\\nsucceeded in winning concessions from its unions.\\r\\n    In order for the other carriers to come down to TWAs wage\\r\\nscale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,\\r\\nanalysts said.\\r\\n    Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they\\r\\nsaid. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines\\r\\ncosts when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a\\r\\nnecessary ingredient for a merger to work.\\r\\n    However, other analysts speculated the managements of\\r\\nPiedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new\\r\\ncompany. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way\\r\\nfor him to exit the company if USAirs airline is then merged\\r\\ninto TWA.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'BAKER INTL &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER Baker International Corp treasurer Eric\\r\\nMattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed\\r\\nmerger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what\\r\\ncompromises might be acceptable to it.\\r\\n    The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr\\r\\noilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when\\r\\nHughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent\\r\\ndecree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.\\r\\n    Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting\\r\\ncalled to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said\\r\\nit hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.\\r\\n    Hughes chairman W.A.

Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from\\r\\nHughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said\\r\\nit was still interested in the merger.\\r\\n    The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its\\r\\ntroubles could make it a takeover candidate.\\r\\n    There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas\\r\\ninvestor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters\\r\\nhe is not interested.\\r\\n    Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities\\r\\nand Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in\\r\\nsome publicly traded company. He declined to identify the\\r\\ntarget other than to rule out Hughes.\\r\\n    One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes\\r\\nturnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of\\r\\nHughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F.

He said the merger lost a\\r\\nlot of its appeal when the U.S. Department of Justice required\\r\\nthat Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.\\r\\n    Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of\\r\\nthe total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said 30 to 40\\r\\npct of the cost savings are tied up in that.\\r\\n    They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,\\r\\nsaid James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.\\r\\nApparently they are willing to continue discussions but\\r\\nwhether they will alter their position, I dont know.\\r\\n    Its getting a little confusing, said James Carroll,\\r\\nanalyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited\\r\\nby Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger tend to be weak.\\r\\nHughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it\\r\\nwanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,\\r\\nthe projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer\\r\\nperiod of time.\\r\\n    Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the\\r\\ncompanies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker\\r\\napparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.\\r\\n    Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln\\r\\ndlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling\\r\\nReed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be\\r\\nsaved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.\\r\\n    Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first\\r\\nsigned the outlook for the industry has improved materially.\\r\\nHughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry\\r\\nis lifting.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ARMTEK &lt;ARM> SELLS TIRE, TRUCK TIRE BUSINESS Armtek Corp, formerly known as\\r\\nArmstrong Rubber Co, said it signed agreements with &lt;Condere\\r\\nCorp> for the sale of its Natchez, Miss. tire plant and its S\\r\\nand A Truck Tire Sales and Services Corp.\\r\\n    Terms were not disclosed.

But there is no\\r\\nway they can trade their way out of this situation, Aldo\\r\\nRoldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase\\r\\nEconometrics, said.\\r\\n    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the\\r\\nproblems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted\\r\\nworld markets, but also had to work to make its position on\\r\\nforeign exchange markets more profitable.\\r\\n    Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and\\r\\nexporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange\\r\\nrates, Roldan said.\\r\\n    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were\\r\\ndepressed and generally did not appear very promising for a\\r\\ncountry like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50\\r\\npct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23\\r\\nbillion dlrs.\\r\\n    But he added: They are always pretty aggressive and they\\r\\nhave good foreign marketing channels.\\r\\n    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be\\r\\ncoffee, and even without background pressure from foreign\\r\\ncreditors the worlds largest producer was expected to hit the\\r\\nmarket this year with a vengeance.\\r\\n    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization\\r\\n(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up\\r\\nearlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing\\r\\neach other of intransigence.\\r\\n    Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,\\r\\nwhich others wanted changed, one senior coffee dealer said.\\r\\n    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to\\r\\npreserve its market share.

They\\r\\nwill be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,\\r\\naccording to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache\\r\\nSecurities Inc.\\r\\n    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus\\r\\ndifficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the\\r\\nBrazil soybean crop. Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and\\r\\nthey cant afford to store the crops, he said.\\r\\n    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time\\r\\nabout large South American crops developing under near ideal\\r\\nconditions towards record yields.\\r\\n    We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than\\r\\nusual, this year in our (U.S.) exports, Loewy said.\\r\\n    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean\\r\\nAssociation (ASA), said this years Brazilian soybean harvest\\r\\ncould total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.\\r\\n    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices\\r\\nare usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the\\r\\nvulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.\\r\\n    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a\\r\\nreduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to\\r\\nfarmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.\\r\\n    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the\\r\\nsoybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices\\r\\nby keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can\\r\\nforfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the\\r\\nloan.\\r\\n    Were getting into a period when they (Brazil) are\\r\\nstarting to harvest and starting to export, Eshleman said.

But there was a clearly\\r\\njustified need for them. There was nothing ominous.\\r\\n    The Fed couldnt have waited until the start of the new\\r\\nstatement period today. If it had, it would have missed its\\r\\n(reserve) projections, added Security Pacifics Bannon.\\r\\n    A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large\\r\\nsingle-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.\\r\\n    Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than-\\r\\nexpected adjusted bank borrowings from the Feds discount\\r\\nwindow, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week,\\r\\ncompared with many economists forecasts of about 200 mln.\\r\\n    For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the\\r\\ndaily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from\\r\\n160 in the prior period.\\r\\n    There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and\\r\\nWednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings, said\\r\\nScott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday\\r\\naverage rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.\\r\\n    Lending further support to the stable policy view was a\\r\\nrelatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the\\r\\nlatest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in\\r\\nthe banking system, economists said.\\r\\n    For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path,\\r\\nwith fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct, said Darwin Beck of\\r\\nFirst Boston Corp. I expect it to continue in that vein.\\r\\n    Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion\\r\\ndlrs, added First Chicagos Johnson. Banks excess reserves\\r\\naveraged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement\\r\\nperiod, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.\\r\\n    After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range\\r\\nto the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little\\r\\nattention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion\\r\\ndlr jump in the week ended February 16.\\r\\n    Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a\\r\\nfine line between the dollars progress in the international\\r\\ncurrency markets and the development of the domestic economy.\\r\\n    The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollars effect on\\r\\nFed policy, said First Chicagos Johnson. Of course, it will\\r\\ntake the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if\\r\\nthe economy is weak, it wont pull back from easing.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ARGENTINA-BRAZIL TRADE JUMPED 90 PCT IN 1986 Trade between Argentina and Brazil\\r\\njumped 90 pct in 1986 versus 1985, Foreign Minister Dante\\r\\nCaputo said.\\r\\n    Speaking to reporters, Caputo said the near doubling in\\r\\ntrade showed the tangible and immediate results of a wide-\\r\\nranging economic integration accord signed by the presidents of\\r\\nboth countries last July.\\r\\n    He said trade last year totalled 1.3 billion dlrs versus\\r\\n700 mln dlrs in 1985.\\r\\n    The accord provided for capital goods trade between the two\\r\\ncountries to rise to 2.0 billion dlrs over four years.\\r\\n    Argentine wheat exports to Brazil will increase from\\r\\n1,375,000 tonnes in 1987 to 2.0 mln tonnes in 1991, the accord\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SANTA FE SOUTHERN PACIFIC APPEALS MERGER RULING Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp will\\r\\nlater today formally ask the U.S. Interstate Commerce\\r\\nCommission (ICC) to reconsider its earlier rejection of the\\r\\nmerger of the holding companys railroad assets, a company\\r\\nspokesman said.\\r\\n    We expect to file papers late tonight asking the ICC to\\r\\nreopen the rail merger case, spokesman Rich Hall said in a\\r\\ntelephone interview from the companys Chicago headquarters.\\r\\n    The ICC had rejected in July, on grounds it would reduce\\r\\ncompetition, the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific\\r\\nRailroads.\\r\\n    The deadline for seeking ICC reconsideration of the merger\\r\\nplan is midnight tonight.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'E.A.

We have the\\r\\nimpression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth\\r\\nthis year.\\r\\n    The big question is whether the governments policy of wage\\r\\nmoderation will be maintained, he added.\\r\\n    The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout\\r\\n1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises\\r\\njustified by increased productivity.\\r\\n    But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond\\r\\nMaire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already\\r\\nrejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built\\r\\ninto future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher\\r\\nprices.\\r\\n    Calling the governments policies unbalanced and unjust, he\\r\\nalso demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He\\r\\nannounced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the\\r\\ngovernment would spend two billion francs on a series of\\r\\nmeasures to boost employment and training\\r\\n    Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate\\r\\nForce Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac\\r\\nearlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of\\r\\nFrances unions, declared the defence of its members earnings\\r\\nits top priority.\\r\\n    But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and\\r\\nstill rising, government supporters and some economic analysts\\r\\nsaid they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.\\r\\n    Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist\\r\\ngovernment and I dont think this administration is going to\\r\\nreverse that, commented Michel Develle, economist at\\r\\nrecently-privatised Banque Paribas.\\r\\n    Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas\\r\\nand the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher\\r\\ninflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n    Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more\\r\\nthan the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7\\r\\nper cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.\\r\\n    But that would still be an exceptional achievement\\r\\nconsidering that for the first time since the Second World War\\r\\nall french prices have been freed, he commented.\\r\\n    Finance Ministry officials said that the governments\\r\\nabolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible\\r\\nfor nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living\\r\\ncosts.\\r\\n    But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should\\r\\nhave no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.\\r\\n    Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long\\r\\nas the government kept wages under control.\\r\\n    Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of\\r\\n1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more\\r\\nthan forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,\\r\\nINSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,\\r\\nhe added.\\r\\n    Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to\\r\\nhelp the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget\\r\\ndeficit, several analysts said.\\r\\n    So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value\\r\\nAdded Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a\\r\\nloss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than\\r\\nexpected growth, they said.\\r\\n   \\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MEXICO SUSPENDS OVERSEAS COFFEE SALES Mexico has temporarily suspended\\r\\noverseas coffee sales due to falling prices triggered by the\\r\\nfailure of the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting\\r\\nto agree a quota system at its latest meeting, the official\\r\\nNotimex news agency said.\\r\\n    Were just waiting a while for prices to improve, an\\r\\nunidentified Mexican trader told the agency.\\r\\n    Mexico has already sold 80 pct of its export coffee\\r\\nproduced in the year to last September, the source said.

This is going to raise some eyebrows\\r\\nat the Fed, McCarthy said.\\r\\n    Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, We\\r\\nhave some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. Its\\r\\ncoming in a lot weaker than I thought.    \\r\\n    The economists were quick to caution that one months data\\r\\nprove nothing, especially because money growth previously had\\r\\nbeen so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct\\r\\nrate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.\\r\\n    Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be\\r\\nexplained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the\\r\\nbooming stock market and is thus not an indication of a\\r\\nslowdown in the business expansion.\\r\\n    But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond\\r\\nmarkets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a\\r\\nreflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.\\r\\n    McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with\\r\\nsigns that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter\\r\\nprogresses. Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as\\r\\nthey were a month ago, he noted.\\r\\n    He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and\\r\\nrises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.\\r\\n    Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct\\r\\nor less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate\\r\\nenough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national\\r\\nproduct for the first quarter proved to be weak. Youd\\r\\ncertainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past.\\r\\n    There was certainly nothing in the Feds latest balance\\r\\nsheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under\\r\\nway, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line\\r\\nwith expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.\\r\\n    Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc\\r\\nargued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to\\r\\nsolve Americas most urgent economic problem, its massive trade\\r\\ndeficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar\\r\\ndepreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to\\r\\nclose the trade gap, Brusca said Im not prepared to be all\\r\\nthat optimistic about the bond market.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ECUADORS CONSUMER PRICES RISE 2.5 PCT IN FEBRUARY Ecuadors consumer price index rose 2.5\\r\\npct in February to 562.4 (base 1978), the National Statistics\\r\\nand Census Institute said.\\r\\n    The rise compared to a 1.8 pct rise in January and a 2.5\\r\\npct rise in February 1986.\\r\\n    The Institute said accumulated overall inflation for the\\r\\nfirst two months of this year was 4.0 pct compared to 5.0 pct\\r\\nfor the same period last year.\\r\\n    Inflation for the 12 months ending February 1987 was 25.5\\r\\npct compared to 13.0 pct for the 12 months ending February\\r\\n1986.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'WEST GERMAN FISHMEAL IMPORTS HIGHEST IN 15 YEARS West German gross fishmeal imports rose\\r\\n60,260 tonnes, or 14.6 pct, last year to 471,891 tonnes, the\\r\\nhighest level since 1972, trade sources said.\\r\\n    Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net\\r\\nimports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.\\r\\n    Total West German consumption was estimated at around a\\r\\nhigh 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices.

This follows a\\r\\n319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously\\r\\nreported 448,000 increase.\\r\\n    Even if you look at January and February together, this is\\r\\nstill a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in\\r\\nthe market, said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.\\r\\n    Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much\\r\\nlarger gains in February U.S. production and income than\\r\\npreviously forecast.\\r\\n    The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from\\r\\n34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose\\r\\n0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since\\r\\nNovember 1966, the Commerce Department said.\\r\\n    The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very\\r\\nlarge increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7\\r\\npct, said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4\\r\\npct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.\\r\\n    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc\\r\\nnoted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour\\r\\nin February from 8.83 dlrs in January.\\r\\n    Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means\\r\\nwell get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis\\r\\nthe wage and salary disbursement, he said.\\r\\n    Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should\\r\\nrise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.\\r\\n    He said the February employment gains are consistent with\\r\\nhis firms first quarter U.S. real gross national product\\r\\ngrowth forecast of 3.7 pct.\\r\\n    Economists agreed that the employment data were negative\\r\\nfor the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy\\r\\nand no easing in the Federal Reserves monetary policy. But\\r\\nmost said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.\\r\\n    This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider\\r\\neasing, said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.  \\r\\n  It gives them more room to address the dollar situation, he\\r\\nsaid. If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so,\\r\\nbut its most likely theyll sit and wait.\\r\\n    The data have not been uniform, Stone added. Durable\\r\\ngoods were weak in January and now employment is strong.\\r\\n    In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct,\\r\\nfollowed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S.\\r\\nretail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap\\r\\nwidened to 14.8 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Things just arent adding up, said Steve Slifer of Lehman\\r\\nGoverment Securities Inc. Consumer spending, capital spending,\\r\\ngoverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first\\r\\nquarter GNP growth of one pct, he said.\\r\\n    The employment and production data point to a big\\r\\ninventory build-up, but thats what we thought in the fourth\\r\\nquarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth.\\r\\n    Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000\\r\\nin January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was\\r\\naccounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery\\r\\nindustries returning to work.\\r\\n    Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains\\r\\nhave resulted from an improving trade outlook.\\r\\n    Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S.\\r\\ntrade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports\\r\\ngrew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in\\r\\nimports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve\\r\\nin the first quarter.\\r\\n    Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter,\\r\\nbut evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper\\r\\nproducts, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show\\r\\nthat trade is improving, Benderley said.\\r\\n    The economy is moving between extremes, he said. Some\\r\\nreports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter\\r\\nGNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct.\\r\\n    A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater\\r\\npart of Februarys employment gain. Retail services employment\\r\\nrose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in\\r\\nJanuary, previously reported at 166,000.\\r\\n    Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But\\r\\nthis follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down\\r\\nfrom a previously reported 142,000 gain.\\r\\n    The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in\\r\\nFebruary at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at\\r\\n6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since\\r\\nMarch 1980, the Commerce Department noted.\\r\\n    The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report,\\r\\nCarson said.

follow the last cut,\\r\\nto 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund\\r\\nBureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.\\r\\n    The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce

spending\\r\\nby 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy\\r\\nperform better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in\\r\\nthe 1980s.\\r\\n    However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation\\r\\nof the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much\\r\\nlower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the\\r\\ngovernment has set itself for 1989.\\r\\n    The governments net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of\\r\\nGNP in 1986.\\r\\n    The report says The most that can be afforded over the next\\r\\nfew years is a zero growth of real non-interest

a strong interest rate policy to signal the\\r\\ngovernments determination to keep its currency strong and to\\r\\ncurb inflation.\\r\\n    It says firmer long-term rates would slow private

The question is\\r\\ntherefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.\\r\\n    Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe\\r\\nLtd, estimated that the government wanted to see the\\r\\ntrade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. Even after this action\\r\\nover the last few weeks, sterlings only just within striking\\r\\ndistance of that range, he said.\\r\\n    Other analysts agree that the government probably has some\\r\\nbroad target range around this area.\\r\\n    However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the\\r\\npound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of\\r\\na loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.\\r\\n    If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they\\r\\nare, whats to stop it (going higher), said John Cox, executive\\r\\ndirector of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London\\r\\nforeign exchange market.\\r\\n    Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active\\r\\nselling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of\\r\\ngeneral market talk of such intervention, and this has helped\\r\\nkeep it below 1.60 dlrs.\\r\\n    The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and\\r\\n1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.\\r\\n    But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling\\r\\nheading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it\\r\\nholds around these levels.\\r\\n    He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest\\r\\nrate boat. If rates dont come down, the market will say they\\r\\nought to have come down and will sell sterling, he said.\\r\\n    Most dealers agree there is a good deal of hot money being\\r\\ninvested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight\\r\\nor one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short\\r\\nnotice.\\r\\n    However, the authorities will hope that at least a\\r\\nproportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.\\r\\n    The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and\\r\\nhave to jack them back up again, said Richard Jeffrey,\\r\\neconomist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.\\r\\n    He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for\\r\\nsterling, at least in the near term.\\r\\n    However, most analysts are still looking for a full point\\r\\nabout March 17, Budget Day.\\r\\n    The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the\\r\\nBudget, said Temperton.\\r\\n    The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the\\r\\nrun-up to a general election, the major factor behind current\\r\\nbullishness in the government bond and currency markets.\\r\\n    Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.\\r\\nHe wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate\\r\\ncut, said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the\\r\\nequities arm of Mercury International Group.\\r\\n    Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the\\r\\nway lower were confounded today.

contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal\\r\\n1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all\\r\\nof the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.\\r\\n    However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic\\r\\nPlanning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise\\r\\nin gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.\\r\\n    But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this\\r\\nfinancial year and net export growth will provide the total\\r\\nsource of gdp growth.\\r\\n    The August budget had forecast domestic demand would\\r\\ncontribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5\\r\\npct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.\\r\\n    Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic\\r\\nparameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a\\r\\nslightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit\\r\\nthan first anticipated.\\r\\n    The government initially forecast a current account deficit\\r\\nfor 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that\\r\\nthe result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion, he said.\\r\\n    Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC\\r\\nin December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is\\r\\nbroadly on track, Keating said.\\r\\n    They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more\\r\\nsluggish than was expected at budget time, he said.\\r\\n    On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more\\r\\nthan expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth\\r\\nin domestic production and employment.\\r\\n    Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation\\r\\nrate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.\\r\\n    Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in\\r\\ninflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary\\r\\neffects wane, he said.\\r\\n    Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick\\r\\nup moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in\\r\\nnet exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from\\r\\nprivate domestic demand.\\r\\n    He said domestic demand growth will be due to a\\r\\nstrengthening in real household disposable income.\\r\\n    The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year\\r\\nshould be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level\\r\\nbroadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.\\r\\n    The current account deficit will continue to show\\r\\nimprovement in 1987/88, Keating said.\\r\\n    As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent\\r\\nyears recede further, and given continued effective wage\\r\\nrestraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88, he\\r\\nsaid.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'INTL TOTALIZATOR &lt;ITSI> SEES BETTER 1ST QTR International Totalizator Systems Inc\\r\\nVice President of Finance Joel Graff said he expects to

Robertus Hazelhoff said the banks 10.3 pct increase\\r\\nin net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was\\r\\nencouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.\\r\\n    Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release\\r\\nof ABNs 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign\\r\\nearnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,\\r\\nnotably in the securities business.\\r\\n    He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10\\r\\nshare-split which should facilitate trade in the banks stock.\\r\\n    News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABNs share\\r\\nprice on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.\\r\\n    Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the\\r\\nfuture trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and\\r\\nABNs share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.\\r\\n    Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986\\r\\nby 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1\\r\\npct to 242 mln guilders, he added.\\r\\n    Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings\\r\\nmargins via traditional lending activities, he said.\\r\\n    Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk\\r\\nprovisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly\\r\\nconcerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor\\r\\nwhich brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank\\r\\nstocks recently.\\r\\n    He said that of the banks estimated 25 financially\\r\\ntroubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin\\r\\nAmerican countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.\\r\\n    He added that losses incurred through loans to tin\\r\\nproducers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had\\r\\nbeen written off.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY M-1 RISES 217 MLN DLRS IN WEEK, BANK OF CANADA SAID\\r\\n ',0\\r\\n'CANADIAN MONEY SUPPLY RISES IN WEEK Canadian narrowly-defined money supply\\r\\nM-1 rose 217 mln dlrs to 32.80 billion dlrs in week ended\\r\\nFebruary 25, Bank of Canada said.\\r\\n    M-1-A, which is M-1 plus daily interest chequable and\\r\\nnon-personal deposits, rose 556 mln dlrs to 75.19 billion dlrs\\r\\nand M-2, which is M-1-A plus other notice and personal\\r\\nfixed-term deposit rose 651 mln dlrs to 176.87 billion dlrs.s\\r\\n    M-3, which is non-personal fixed term deposits and foreign\\r\\ncurrency deposits of residents booked at chartered banks in\\r\\nCanada, rose 992 mln dlrs to 216.03 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Chartered bank general loans outstanding rose 481 mln dlrs\\r\\nto 124.99 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Canadian liquid plus short term assets fell 854 mln dlrs to\\r\\n35.40 billion dlrs and total Canadian dollar major assets of\\r\\nthe chartered banks fell 118 mln dlrs to 221.20 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Chartered bank net foreign currency assets fell 23 mln dlrs\\r\\nto minus 1.92 billion dlrs.\\r\\n    Notes in circulation totalled 16.24 billion dlrs, up 76 mln\\r\\ndlrs from the week before.\\r\\n    Government cash balances fell 565 mln dlrs to 4.31 billion\\r\\ndlrs in week ended March 4.\\r\\n    Government securities outstanding rose 1.25 billion dlrs to\\r\\n224.09 billion dlrs in week ended March 4, treasury bills rose\\r\\n950 mln dlrs to 74.55 billion dlrs and Canada Savings Bonds\\r\\nfell 57 mln dlrs to 44.34 billion dlrs.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AID TO JOBLESS The government plans to go ahead with a\\r\\nthree billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed,\\r\\nwith the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to\\r\\neveryone becoming redundant, government officials said.\\r\\n    At present only about one-third of the countrys 2.6 mln\\r\\njobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive\\r\\nunemployment benefit.\\r\\n    Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television\\r\\ninterviewer, As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in\\r\\na matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the\\r\\nright to social benefits.\\r\\n    The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment\\r\\nthrough retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5\\r\\nbillion franc government fund set up last month to finance\\r\\nspending on special areas of concern.\\r\\n    Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers\\r\\nhit by European Community cost-cutting measures.\\r\\n    French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8\\r\\nmln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in\\r\\n1981.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'USSR WHEAT BONUS OFFER SAID STILL UNDER DEBATE The Reagan administration continues\\r\\nto debate whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet\\r\\nUnion, but would need assurances from the Soviets that they\\r\\nwould buy the wheat before the subsidy offer would be made, a\\r\\nsenior U.S. Agriculture Department official said.\\r\\n    I think it still is under active debate whether or not it\\r\\nwould be advisable to make an the export enhancement offer to\\r\\nthe Soviets, Thomas Kay, administrator of the departments\\r\\nForeign Agriculture Service, told Reuters.\\r\\n    Wed need some assurances from them (the Soviets) that they\\r\\nwould buy if offered the wheat under the subsidy plan, he said.\\r\\nKay called reports that such an offer was imminent premature.\\r\\n    The Reagan administrations cabinet-level Economic Policy\\r\\nCouncil is set to meet today to discuss, among other matters,\\r\\nagricultural policy but is not expected to address a wheat\\r\\nsubsidy offer to the Soviet Union, administration officials\\r\\nsaid earlier.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'SUN ELECTRIC CORP &lt;SE> 1ST QTR JAN 31 OPER NET Oper shr profit nine cts vs loss seven cts\\r\\n    Oper net profit 628,000 vs loss 491,000\\r\\n    Sales 50.7 mln vs 41.8 mln\\r\\n    Avg shrs 7,033,000 vs 6,557,000\\r\\n    Note: Oper net excludes extraordinary profit of 423,000\\r\\ndlrs, or six cts a shr, and 110,000 dlrs, or one ct a share,\\r\\nrespectively, in 1987 and 1986 quarters, from utilization of\\r\\ntax loss carryforwards.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'CANADA CORN DECISION UNJUSTIFIED -

That could send prices\\r\\n50 cts to a dollar higher, he added.\\r\\n    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to\\r\\n18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.\\r\\n    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in\\r\\nFebruary more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a\\r\\nbarrel.\\r\\n    Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that\\r\\noil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its\\r\\n15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come\\r\\nunder question, McKinley said.\\r\\n    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly\\r\\nreport said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in\\r\\nindustrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during\\r\\nthe first quarter of this year.\\r\\n    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first\\r\\nquarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose\\r\\ninventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln\\r\\ntonnes, or about 74 days consumption.\\r\\n    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd\\r\\ndraw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday\\r\\nfed speculation that other major companies were destocking.\\r\\n    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a\\r\\nso-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying\\r\\nofficially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization\\r\\nto offer discounts to the official price.\\r\\n    This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the\\r\\nultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively\\r\\nsoon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),\\r\\nthe general trading manager of an international oil company\\r\\ntold Reuters in a telephone interview.\\r\\n    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting\\r\\nexcess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own\\r\\noutput, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to\\r\\nbe 14.7 mln bpd this week.\\r\\n    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend\\r\\noil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.\\r\\n    This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000\\r\\nbpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,\\r\\nthe larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting\\r\\nit to be there, McKinley said.\\r\\n    International oil traders said that other short-haul\\r\\ncrudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian\\r\\nrefiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily\\r\\navailable Mideast crudes earlier this week.\\r\\n    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up\\r\\nthe price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading\\r\\nmanagers at several companies told Reuters.\\r\\n    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long\\r\\nOPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.\\r\\n    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity\\r\\nManagement, said OPEC production was lower because of the\\r\\nSaudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it\\r\\ngives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas.\\r\\n     He added, The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other\\r\\nmembers who produce over their quota, and the drain on the\\r\\nSaudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low\\r\\nas 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price, he added.\\r\\n    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the\\r\\nspot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.\\r\\n    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery\\r\\ninto the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which\\r\\ntraded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of\\r\\n18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.\\r\\n    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far\\r\\nEast at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.\\r\\n    There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government\\r\\ndeals, which are below official prices and this is probably\\r\\nbeing resold, one international trader said.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE)\\r\\nwill start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn\\r\\nsyrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission\\r\\n(CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.\\r\\n    Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange\\r\\nexpects contract approval at CFTCs Tuesday meeting. It has\\r\\nbeen under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in\\r\\nDecember, 1985.\\r\\n    The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of\\r\\n55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank\\r\\ntruck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet\\r\\nmilling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most\\r\\ncommonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other\\r\\nbeverages.\\r\\n    Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production\\r\\nfacilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated\\r\\nby the symbol HF, would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months\\r\\ntraded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of\\r\\nMarch, May, July, September and December.\\r\\n    Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a\\r\\nminimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation\\r\\nof one dlr per CWT.\\r\\n    We hope the producers and users of fructose will be\\r\\nactively involved, those producers being the large processors,\\r\\nthe corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage\\r\\nbottlers, Henderson said.

Anything is possible at this phase, even\\r\\nadjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.\\r\\n    If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the\\r\\nsupermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a\\r\\nresult, industry sources said.\\r\\n    Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about\\r\\nsteady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an\\r\\nupswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either,\\r\\nthey said.\\r\\n REUTER\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'FIRST FEDERAL BROOKSVILLE &lt;FFBV> SETS QUARTERLY Qtly div four cts vs four cts prior\\r\\n    Pay March 31\\r\\n    Record March 20\\r\\n    NOTE: First Federal Savings and Loan Association of\\r\\nBrooksville.\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'ALUMINUM CO OF AMERICA &lt;AA> REGULAR DIVIDEND Qtly div 30 cts vs 30 cts in prior qtr\\r\\n    Payable May 25\\r\\n    Record May one\\r\\n Reuter\\r\\n&#3;',0\\r\\n'&lt;TECHNIGEN PLATINUM CORP> IN METALS FIND Technigen Platinum corp said it\\r\\ninitial results of a 13-hole drilling program on its R.M.
